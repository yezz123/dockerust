# dockerust

The purpose of this exciting project is to build a fully-functional Docker registry server in pure Rust. This is an ambitious undertaking that will expand the capabilities of Rust and demonstrate its versatility.

Although currently only read operations are implemented, I am eager to add write features very soon.

This will unlock the full potential of the registry and make it a robust, production-ready solution.
